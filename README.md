# EnerMod
#This is the model of tsyp13 pes and yp challenge

This project, titled EnerMod, directly addresses the challenge topic of Optimizing Energy Consumption. Our solution moves beyond passive monitoring to create an active, intelligent management system that automates energy savings and enhances grid stability at the household level.

Data Acquisition
The dataset, that was used for the development of the machine learning models, was taken from:
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/235/individual+household+electric+power+consumption

Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values.
Data Smoothing (exponential smoothing).
Handling outliers (we detected them using standard deviation).
Data normalization (scaling the values between [0,1]).
Data resampling ().
Splitting the Dataset.
Training set.
Validation set.
Test set.
